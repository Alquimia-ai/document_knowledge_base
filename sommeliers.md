# What is wine?

Wine is the beverage produced by the alcoholic fermentation of fresh grapes or fresh grape juice (must). The origin of the vine dates back to around 6000 B.C. in the region of Mesopotamia. Initially, wine was mainly used for ceremonies and sacred rituals as offerings to the gods. This cultivation spread throughout the Mediterranean, reaching Greece, Italy, Spain, and France—countries that, due to their climate, soil, and history, have expanded the production and culture of wine across all continents. The production and consumption of wine extend worldwide. The great variety of climates, soils, the enormous number of grapevine varieties, the viticulturists and oenologists themselves, and the different techniques of winemaking, aging, and conservation have led to a great diversity of wines.

## The wine

The vine is a shrub made up of:

- Root: supplies nutrients to the vine.
- Trunk: stores reserve substances, supports the arms and shoots of the vine, and conducts water and sap.
- Arms: responsible for conducting nutrients and distributing the vegetation and fruits in space.
- Shoots (when green) or canes (when dry): send nutrients to leaves and fruit.
- Leaves: the most important organs of the vine, as they are responsible for transforming raw sap into elaborated sap and carrying out the plant's vital.- functions: transpiration, respiration, and photosynthesis.

Bunches:
clusters of grapes connected by stems to a stalk hanging from the cane.

The fruit
Grapes are the fruit expression of the vine. The bunch is divided into the following components:

- Peduncle: the connection between the shoot and the bunch.
- Rachis: the woody part of the bunch. It is usually removed as it adds acidity, roughness, and green aromas to the wine.
- Berry or grape: composed of three parts:
- Skin: contains the compounds that give color and texture to the wines, as well as most of the aromas.
- Pulp: contains the must, mostly water with sugars. It does not contribute color to the wines.
- Seeds: found inside the pulp. They provide tannins and oils that can deteriorate flavors and aromas.


# Wine Production

## Transport 
It is carried out as gently as possible so that the grapes do not arrive damaged and premature fermentation does not occur. High-quality wines receive selected bunches transported in small boxes of a maximum of 15 kg.

## Destemming 
The rachis is removed to prevent these woody parts from providing acids, roughness, and green aromas. In some red wines, the rachis is left to allow internal fermentation of the grape (carbonic maceration) or to acquire more herbaceous aromas. When not removed in white wines, the goal is to achieve a gentler extraction of the must.

## Crushing
Without breaking the seeds, the grapes are crushed to facilitate the release of the must from the interior. Contact between the skins and the must is necessary to give the wine color and texture.

## Fermentation and maceration
 This is the process of transforming the sugars contained in the must into alcohol thanks to the action of yeasts (micro-fungi). Temperature control is very important because if it is too low or too high, the yeasts will stop functioning. The fermentation time varies depending on the grape varieties, temperature, yeasts, and especially our determination, as we can decide when to stop it. This generates the different types of wine based on the residual sugar content (unfermented):
    - Dry: Less than 5 grams of residual sugar per liter.
    - Semi-dry: Between 15 and 30 grams of residual sugar per liter.
    - Sweet: More than 50 grams of residual sugar per liter.
 In addition, while fermentation is taking place, the maceration of skins and must occurs, adding more color and texture to the wine. Since the carbon dioxide produced by the yeast pushes the skins to the upper area, we will move the skins through remontage (pumping must from the lower part to the upper part using a hose) and punching down (submerging the skins into the must from the upper part).

 In white and rosé wines, this maceration is done before fermentation, simply by leaving the skins and must in contact.

## Pressing
 After fermentation, the liquid part (free-run wine) is drained from the tank, and the solid part is taken to a press. Pressing helps us extract the last part of the wine, which will be the least harsh, and it will be mixed with the previously reserved free-run wine.

Within the aging process of wine, we will discover two storage systems: the barrel and the bottle with cork:

## Barrel
It is the wooden container (usually oak) where the wine will remain during its first phase of aging. Generally, it has a capacity of 225 liters (Bordeaux, used in Rioja), although there are barrels of other volumes. When the barrel is made through the use of fire, different types of toasts are created, which disappear with use and contact with the wine. Thus, the newer the barrel, the more intense the effect on the wine. Additionally, the porosity of the wood causes the wine to oxidize more quickly. Newer barrels have a more open porosity, so the oxidation is faster, while older barrels result in slower oxidation. The type of oak or its origin gives different types of aromas and oxidation to the wine.
    - French oak:gives a toasted touch, it is an oak with lower pore density and more elegance, so it is recommended to shorten the aging time in the barrel. The oxidation is less, thus maintaining the fruit much fresher.
    - American oak: provides a more woody and aggressive contribution due to the higher concentration of tannins. This aggressiveness softens over time, providing pleasant spicy notes. The oxidation is more intense.

## Bottle and Cork
After the time in the barrel, the wine needs a resting period in the bottle so that the characteristics of the wine and those acquired in the barrel harmonize and blend properly. During this period, it is very important to keep the bottle lying down so that the wine soaks the cork, keeping it moist and airtight, and preventing oxygen from entering. Bottles should be stored in places free from air currents and temperature changes, with a relative humidity above 70%. The larger the container, the slower the wine's aging process.

The cork's function is to prevent the entry of oxygen, microorganisms, and bacteria that can damage or alter the wine in the bottle. Corks are approximately 45 to 55 mm in length. Their length will delay oxygen from entering the bottle. When the cork dries out, it can cause openings through which oxidation can occur. For good preservation, bottles should be placed horizontally so that the wine soaks the cork and keeps it moist. It is important to note that cork does not leave odors, but its reaction with chlorines can generate cave, mold, or wet cardboard aromas, known as “cork taint” or TCA.

# Tasting: Definition

## Tasting 
is an organoleptic analysis of wine, a completely objective analysis in which the sensory composition of the wine must be determined. Sensory analysis involves examining the wine through our senses using a method. In this definition, three key words explain what it consists of and how it is executed.

## ANALYSIS. 
Analyzing means breaking down a reality into a series of parts, thus studying an overall view of that reality. In sensory analysis, the instruments will be our senses and the parameters to be studied are a series of dimensions that can only be appreciated through them.

## SENSES. 
As mentioned, they are the instruments used to carry out this analysis. They thus become the link between the wine and our brain, which will then process all the information obtained through them. If one does not use their sensitivity, a large part of the reality of the wine cannot be known. The senses we will use in the analysis are: sight, smell, taste, and touch.

## METHOD. 
This indicates that this analytical activity is not carried out spontaneously but that there must be a series of steps to follow, a procedure that every taster must consider to conduct the tasting of a wine with full rigor of knowledge.

# Wine Tasting Guide

## Step #1: Visual Appearance

In the visual phase, the following characteristics are studied: clarity, brightness, intensity, color, fluidity, and density.

### Clarity and Brightness
To analyze these, we need to tilt the glass 45º forward against a white background. Clarity determines the transparency of the wine (ensuring there is no dirt). It is expressed from highest to lowest: clear, slightly cloudy, and cloudy. Brightness is represented by light spectra reflected in the wine when it is clear. Remember that there are unfiltered wines that, although they have particles in suspension, are still clear as they maintain brightness.

### Intensity
Analyzing means breaking down a reality into a series of parts, thus studying an overall view of that reality. In sensory analysis, the instruments will be our senses, and the parameters to be studied are a series of dimensions that can only be appreciated through them.

### Color
Below are the different shades of wines according to their age, from youngest to oldest:

#### Red Wines
 - Violet
 - Garnet
 - Cherry
 - Dark Cherry
 - Ruby
 - Tile
 - Orange
 - Brown

#### Rosé Wines
 - Violet Pink
 - Strawberry Pink
 - Currant Pink
 - Salmon Pink
 - Salmon
 - Onion Skin
 - Orange
 - Brown

#### White Wines
 - Colorless
 - Greenish Yellow
 - Lemon Yellow
 - Straw Yellow
 - Golden Yellow
 - Gold
 - Amber Yellow
 - Brown Yellow

### Fluidity and Density
To analyze these characteristics, we must swirl the wine in the glass so that drops appear, indicating the amount of sugars (glycerin) and alcohols. These drops are called “tears.” Fluidity is related to the tears that run down the glass wall faster, representing alcohol. The more tears, the higher the alcohol content. On the other hand, the tears that remain at the highest point the wine reached represent density. These are the sugars that stick to the glass wall. Another way to see the wine’s density is to tilt the glass back to 45º and look at the watery arc on the outer edge of the wine. The wider it is, the lighter the wine.

## Step #2: Smell (or "Nose")

The olfactory phase is the most important part of wine tasting. The aromas of wine provide information about the grape varieties, the production method or aging, the quality of the production, the age of the wine, and its evolution. In wine tasting, we consider aroma to be the positive impressions, while we use the term odor to refer to negative or improper sensations of the wine. For example, we will talk about a fruity or vanilla aroma and an odor of cork or humidity.

### Aromatic Compounds and Olfaction
The different compounds found in any material, within its creation or growth, give us the precursors or aromatic particles, that is, the aromas. These aromas are carried and conducted by the air to reach our olfactory system. The two airways are the mouth and the nose, both connected by the retronasal passage. The direct route (nose and nasal passages) receives most of the aromas. Between the nasal passages, we have nerves connected to the brain (olfactory nerves) that send the information of the aromas to the brain. The brain connects that information with an emotion (color, person, anecdote…) to give us the sensation of aromatic perception. If we lack that emotion or have never smelled an aroma, the aromatic perception will be null.

### Aromas
Aromas can be divided into the following groups:
 - Fruity: Peach, apple, banana…
 - Animal: Animal hides, leather…
 - Empyreumatic: Smoky, burnt, cooked smells.
 - Spices: Cinnamon, pepper, nutmeg…
 - Floral: Rose, lavender, violet…
 - Balsamic: Licorice, mint, anise…
 - Vegetal: Pine, hay, pepper…
 - Mineral: Earth, metal, limestone…
 - Empyreumatic: Caramel, coffee, cocoa, toasted…

#### Types of Aromas
They can be divided into three types:

##### Primary Aromas:
These are aromas from the grape. The land where it was grown, the climate, the terrain, and the hydrography affect these aromas. To detect them, it is best not to swirl the wine to find the lightest ones, and then swirl it a bit to get more intensity. They are usually from fruity, mineral, floral, and vegetal groups.

White wines: 
Aromas of both citrus and white and stone fruits (lemon, apple, or peach). Floral aromas (white flowers). Mineral aromas (limestone, earth). Vegetal aromas (tomato stems).
Rosé wines: Aromas from stone fruits to red fruits (apricot, strawberries); Floral aromas (roses).
Red wines: Fruity aromas from red to black fruits (strawberries, blackberries); Floral aromas (violets); Mineral aromas (wet earth); Vegetal aromas (pepper).

#### Secondary Aromas: 
These are aromas produced during the winemaking process. The transformation of sugar into alcohol or the change of acids in the wine is accompanied by a chain of enzymatic reactions that modify and multiply the initial aroma (tropical fruit aromas, dairy aromas like butter). The contact of the yeast with the wine for long periods can generate bakery aromas.

#### Tertiary Aromas:
These develop during the aging of the wine both in the barrel and in the bottle and are due to new substances synthesized or transformed during the process. Additionally, there is an evolution of primary and secondary aromas. The procedure, in this case, is first to smell the wine in a static state and then to swirl it well so that stronger aromas appear with the evaporation of the alcohol. This type of aroma is known as bouquet and can be distinguished into two types:
Oxidation: Aromas acquired during barrel and bottle aging.
Reduction: Aromas acquired in the bottle due to lack of oxygen.
Some tertiary aromas are: vanilla, leather, toasted bread, almonds, chocolate, coffee, animal hides.

## Step #3: Taste (or "Palate")

### Gustatory Phase
During the gustatory phase, we analyze both flavors and textures. To analyze this phase, we need to take a small sip of wine and pass it over the tongue as well as the upper and lower gums and cheeks. Finally, we expel it.

### Flavors and Aromas
The tongue, with its taste buds, detects different flavors: sweetness on the tip; acidity on the sides and lower sides; saltiness on the front sides; and bitterness at the back of the tongue. Regarding aromas, all those flavor sensations such as fruits are actually aromas that move from the mouth through the retronasal passage to the olfactory nerves. In this case, the brain registers the information as if it were a flavor. Lastly, we need to measure the time it takes for all the aromas to disappear from our mouth. This phenomenon is called “aftertaste” or “persistence.”

### Textures
When analyzing textures, we see that density is generated through water, alcohol, and sugars. But there are other compounds that change the texture of the wine. Acids increase saliva and soften the sugars and alcohol. However, tannins tend to make the wine denser in texture. We will see that the older the wines are, the smoother their texture becomes, as tannins become softer over time.

## Step #4: Aftertaste (or "Finish")

After you have smelled and tasted the wine, swallow it and observe what happens next. Do you notice new tastes or aromas? Is the aftertaste pleasant or bad? Does the alcohol make for a hot, rough experience—or is it barely detectable? How long do the aromas remain in your mouth and nose? This is the "finish" of the wine.

## How to Learn More About Wine From Tasting

- Follow the steps above and pay close attention each time you taste wine.
- Taste "blind"—without knowledge of what you are analyzing—to avoid bias.
- Taste more than one wine at a time; differentiate them carefully, side-by-side.
- Start with wines from classical appellations, not exotics. (See a good textbook.)
- Occasionally buy wines at higher prices—these are the best representatives.
- If that's not in your budget, skip a few value bottles to save for better ones.
