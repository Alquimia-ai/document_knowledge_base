# What is wine?

Wine is a beverage produced through the process of alcoholic fermentation of fresh grapes or fresh grape juice, commonly referred to as must. The process involves yeast converting the sugars present in the grapes into alcohol and carbon dioxide, resulting in the creation of wine. This transformation not only yields alcohol but also develops complex flavors and aromas that are characteristic of the beverage.

### The Origin and History of Wine

The history of wine dates back to around 6000 B.C., with its origins traced to the region of Mesopotamia, which is present-day Iran, Iraq, and Turkey. Archaeological evidence suggests that the cultivation of grapevines and the production of wine were integral to ancient civilizations. Wine played a significant role in various cultures, primarily being used in ceremonies and sacred rituals as offerings to the gods. 

As the knowledge and techniques for wine production advanced, the practice spread throughout the Mediterranean region. Ancient civilizations such as the Greeks, Etruscans, and Romans embraced viticulture and oenology (the science of wine and winemaking), integrating wine into their daily lives and cultural practices. Greece, Italy, Spain, and France became prominent centers for wine production due to their favorable climates, suitable soils, and rich histories.

### The Spread and Evolution of Wine Culture

The spread of wine culture continued throughout history, particularly with the expansion of the Roman Empire, which introduced viticulture to many parts of Europe. Over centuries, these regions refined their techniques and developed unique styles of wine that reflected their local terroir—a combination of climate, soil, and topography that imparts distinctive characteristics to the grapes grown there.

By the Middle Ages, wine had become an important commodity in Europe, and monasteries played a crucial role in preserving and advancing winemaking techniques. The monks meticulously tended vineyards and experimented with aging and fermentation methods, leading to significant improvements in wine quality.

### Global Expansion and Diversity of Wine

The Age of Exploration in the 15th and 16th centuries facilitated the global spread of viticulture. European settlers brought grapevines to the New World, including regions such as the Americas, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. These new wine-producing areas contributed to the diversity of wine by introducing different grape varieties and adopting innovative winemaking practices.

Today, wine production and consumption are truly global, with vineyards found in nearly every continent. The diversity of climates and soils, along with the vast number of grapevine varieties and the expertise of viticulturists and oenologists, have led to an incredible range of wines. Each wine is a reflection of its origin, embodying the unique characteristics of the place where it was produced.

### The Art and Science of Winemaking

Winemaking is both an art and a science, requiring a deep understanding of grape cultivation (viticulture) and the winemaking process (oenology). Winemakers employ various techniques to influence the style and quality of the wine. These techniques include:

- **Harvesting**: The timing of grape harvest significantly impacts the wine's flavor and structure. Grapes may be harvested early for higher acidity or later for increased sugar content and fuller body.

- **Fermentation**: Yeast selection, fermentation temperature, and fermentation vessel (such as stainless steel tanks or oak barrels) all affect the wine's characteristics. Some winemakers opt for wild or indigenous yeast for spontaneous fermentation, while others use cultured yeast strains for more predictable results.

- **Aging**: Wines can be aged in different types of barrels (oak, stainless steel, or concrete) to impart specific flavors and textures. Oak barrels, for instance, can add notes of vanilla, spice, and toast to the wine.

- **Blending**: Winemakers may blend different grape varieties or wines from different vineyards to achieve a desired balance and complexity.

- **Bottling and Storage**: Proper bottling techniques and storage conditions are crucial for preserving wine quality. Some wines benefit from further aging in the bottle, while others are best enjoyed young.

## The wine

The vine is a shrub made up of:

- Root: supplies nutrients to the vine.
- Trunk: stores reserve substances, supports the arms and shoots of the vine, and conducts water and sap.
- Arms: responsible for conducting nutrients and distributing the vegetation and fruits in space.
- Shoots (when green) or canes (when dry): send nutrients to leaves and fruit.
- Leaves: the most important organs of the vine, as they are responsible for transforming raw sap into elaborated sap and carrying out the plant's vital.- functions: transpiration, respiration, and photosynthesis.

Bunches:
clusters of grapes connected by stems to a stalk hanging from the cane.

The fruit
Grapes are the fruit expression of the vine. The bunch is divided into the following components:

- Peduncle: the connection between the shoot and the bunch.
- Rachis: the woody part of the bunch. It is usually removed as it adds acidity, roughness, and green aromas to the wine.
- Berry or grape: composed of three parts:
- Skin: contains the compounds that give color and texture to the wines, as well as most of the aromas.
- Pulp: contains the must, mostly water with sugars. It does not contribute color to the wines.
- Seeds: found inside the pulp. They provide tannins and oils that can deteriorate flavors and aromas.


# Wine Production

## Transport 
It is carried out as gently as possible so that the grapes do not arrive damaged and premature fermentation does not occur. High-quality wines receive selected bunches transported in small boxes of a maximum of 15 kg.

## Destemming 
The rachis is removed to prevent these woody parts from providing acids, roughness, and green aromas. In some red wines, the rachis is left to allow internal fermentation of the grape (carbonic maceration) or to acquire more herbaceous aromas. When not removed in white wines, the goal is to achieve a gentler extraction of the must.

## Crushing
Without breaking the seeds, the grapes are crushed to facilitate the release of the must from the interior. Contact between the skins and the must is necessary to give the wine color and texture.

## Fermentation and maceration
 This is the process of transforming the sugars contained in the must into alcohol thanks to the action of yeasts (micro-fungi). Temperature control is very important because if it is too low or too high, the yeasts will stop functioning. The fermentation time varies depending on the grape varieties, temperature, yeasts, and especially our determination, as we can decide when to stop it. This generates the different types of wine based on the residual sugar content (unfermented):
    - Dry: Less than 5 grams of residual sugar per liter.
    - Semi-dry: Between 15 and 30 grams of residual sugar per liter.
    - Sweet: More than 50 grams of residual sugar per liter.
 In addition, while fermentation is taking place, the maceration of skins and must occurs, adding more color and texture to the wine. Since the carbon dioxide produced by the yeast pushes the skins to the upper area, we will move the skins through remontage (pumping must from the lower part to the upper part using a hose) and punching down (submerging the skins into the must from the upper part).

 In white and rosé wines, this maceration is done before fermentation, simply by leaving the skins and must in contact.

## Pressing
 After fermentation, the liquid part (free-run wine) is drained from the tank, and the solid part is taken to a press. Pressing helps us extract the last part of the wine, which will be the least harsh, and it will be mixed with the previously reserved free-run wine.

Within the aging process of wine, we will discover two storage systems: the barrel and the bottle with cork:

## Barrel
It is the wooden container (usually oak) where the wine will remain during its first phase of aging. Generally, it has a capacity of 225 liters (Bordeaux, used in Rioja), although there are barrels of other volumes. When the barrel is made through the use of fire, different types of toasts are created, which disappear with use and contact with the wine. Thus, the newer the barrel, the more intense the effect on the wine. Additionally, the porosity of the wood causes the wine to oxidize more quickly. Newer barrels have a more open porosity, so the oxidation is faster, while older barrels result in slower oxidation. The type of oak or its origin gives different types of aromas and oxidation to the wine.
    - French oak:gives a toasted touch, it is an oak with lower pore density and more elegance, so it is recommended to shorten the aging time in the barrel. The oxidation is less, thus maintaining the fruit much fresher.
    - American oak: provides a more woody and aggressive contribution due to the higher concentration of tannins. This aggressiveness softens over time, providing pleasant spicy notes. The oxidation is more intense.

## Bottle and Cork
After the time in the barrel, the wine needs a resting period in the bottle so that the characteristics of the wine and those acquired in the barrel harmonize and blend properly. During this period, it is very important to keep the bottle lying down so that the wine soaks the cork, keeping it moist and airtight, and preventing oxygen from entering. Bottles should be stored in places free from air currents and temperature changes, with a relative humidity above 70%. The larger the container, the slower the wine's aging process.

The cork's function is to prevent the entry of oxygen, microorganisms, and bacteria that can damage or alter the wine in the bottle. Corks are approximately 45 to 55 mm in length. Their length will delay oxygen from entering the bottle. When the cork dries out, it can cause openings through which oxidation can occur. For good preservation, bottles should be placed horizontally so that the wine soaks the cork and keeps it moist. It is important to note that cork does not leave odors, but its reaction with chlorines can generate cave, mold, or wet cardboard aromas, known as “cork taint” or TCA.

# Tasting: Definition

## Tasting 
is an organoleptic analysis of wine, a completely objective analysis in which the sensory composition of the wine must be determined. Sensory analysis involves examining the wine through our senses using a method. In this definition, three key words explain what it consists of and how it is executed.

## ANALYSIS. 
Analyzing means breaking down a reality into a series of parts, thus studying an overall view of that reality. In sensory analysis, the instruments will be our senses and the parameters to be studied are a series of dimensions that can only be appreciated through them.

## SENSES. 
As mentioned, they are the instruments used to carry out this analysis. They thus become the link between the wine and our brain, which will then process all the information obtained through them. If one does not use their sensitivity, a large part of the reality of the wine cannot be known. The senses we will use in the analysis are: sight, smell, taste, and touch.

## METHOD. 
This indicates that this analytical activity is not carried out spontaneously but that there must be a series of steps to follow, a procedure that every taster must consider to conduct the tasting of a wine with full rigor of knowledge.

# Wine Tasting Guide

## Step #1: Visual Appearance

In the visual phase, the following characteristics are studied: clarity, brightness, intensity, color, fluidity, and density.

### Clarity and Brightness
To analyze these, we need to tilt the glass 45º forward against a white background. Clarity determines the transparency of the wine (ensuring there is no dirt). It is expressed from highest to lowest: clear, slightly cloudy, and cloudy. Brightness is represented by light spectra reflected in the wine when it is clear. Remember that there are unfiltered wines that, although they have particles in suspension, are still clear as they maintain brightness.

### Intensity
Analyzing means breaking down a reality into a series of parts, thus studying an overall view of that reality. In sensory analysis, the instruments will be our senses, and the parameters to be studied are a series of dimensions that can only be appreciated through them.

### Color
Below are the different shades of wines according to their age, from youngest to oldest:

#### Red Wines
 - Violet
 - Garnet
 - Cherry
 - Dark Cherry
 - Ruby
 - Tile
 - Orange
 - Brown

#### Rosé Wines
 - Violet Pink
 - Strawberry Pink
 - Currant Pink
 - Salmon Pink
 - Salmon
 - Onion Skin
 - Orange
 - Brown

#### White Wines
 - Colorless
 - Greenish Yellow
 - Lemon Yellow
 - Straw Yellow
 - Golden Yellow
 - Gold
 - Amber Yellow
 - Brown Yellow

### Fluidity and Density
To analyze these characteristics, we must swirl the wine in the glass so that drops appear, indicating the amount of sugars (glycerin) and alcohols. These drops are called “tears.” Fluidity is related to the tears that run down the glass wall faster, representing alcohol. The more tears, the higher the alcohol content. On the other hand, the tears that remain at the highest point the wine reached represent density. These are the sugars that stick to the glass wall. Another way to see the wine’s density is to tilt the glass back to 45º and look at the watery arc on the outer edge of the wine. The wider it is, the lighter the wine.

## Step #2: Smell (or "Nose")

The olfactory phase is the most important part of wine tasting. The aromas of wine provide information about the grape varieties, the production method or aging, the quality of the production, the age of the wine, and its evolution. In wine tasting, we consider aroma to be the positive impressions, while we use the term odor to refer to negative or improper sensations of the wine. For example, we will talk about a fruity or vanilla aroma and an odor of cork or humidity.

### Aromatic Compounds and Olfaction
The different compounds found in any material, within its creation or growth, give us the precursors or aromatic particles, that is, the aromas. These aromas are carried and conducted by the air to reach our olfactory system. The two airways are the mouth and the nose, both connected by the retronasal passage. The direct route (nose and nasal passages) receives most of the aromas. Between the nasal passages, we have nerves connected to the brain (olfactory nerves) that send the information of the aromas to the brain. The brain connects that information with an emotion (color, person, anecdote…) to give us the sensation of aromatic perception. If we lack that emotion or have never smelled an aroma, the aromatic perception will be null.

### Aromas
Aromas can be divided into the following groups:
 - Fruity: Peach, apple, banana…
 - Animal: Animal hides, leather…
 - Empyreumatic: Smoky, burnt, cooked smells.
 - Spices: Cinnamon, pepper, nutmeg…
 - Floral: Rose, lavender, violet…
 - Balsamic: Licorice, mint, anise…
 - Vegetal: Pine, hay, pepper…
 - Mineral: Earth, metal, limestone…
 - Empyreumatic: Caramel, coffee, cocoa, toasted…

#### Types of Aromas
They can be divided into three types:

##### Primary Aromas:
These are aromas from the grape. The land where it was grown, the climate, the terrain, and the hydrography affect these aromas. To detect them, it is best not to swirl the wine to find the lightest ones, and then swirl it a bit to get more intensity. They are usually from fruity, mineral, floral, and vegetal groups.

White wines: 
Aromas of both citrus and white and stone fruits (lemon, apple, or peach). Floral aromas (white flowers). Mineral aromas (limestone, earth). Vegetal aromas (tomato stems).
Rosé wines: Aromas from stone fruits to red fruits (apricot, strawberries); Floral aromas (roses).
Red wines: Fruity aromas from red to black fruits (strawberries, blackberries); Floral aromas (violets); Mineral aromas (wet earth); Vegetal aromas (pepper).

#### Secondary Aromas: 
These are aromas produced during the winemaking process. The transformation of sugar into alcohol or the change of acids in the wine is accompanied by a chain of enzymatic reactions that modify and multiply the initial aroma (tropical fruit aromas, dairy aromas like butter). The contact of the yeast with the wine for long periods can generate bakery aromas.

#### Tertiary Aromas:
These develop during the aging of the wine both in the barrel and in the bottle and are due to new substances synthesized or transformed during the process. Additionally, there is an evolution of primary and secondary aromas. The procedure, in this case, is first to smell the wine in a static state and then to swirl it well so that stronger aromas appear with the evaporation of the alcohol. This type of aroma is known as bouquet and can be distinguished into two types:
Oxidation: Aromas acquired during barrel and bottle aging.
Reduction: Aromas acquired in the bottle due to lack of oxygen.
Some tertiary aromas are: vanilla, leather, toasted bread, almonds, chocolate, coffee, animal hides.

## Step #3: Taste (or "Palate")

### Gustatory Phase
During the gustatory phase, we analyze both flavors and textures. To analyze this phase, we need to take a small sip of wine and pass it over the tongue as well as the upper and lower gums and cheeks. Finally, we expel it.

### Flavors and Aromas
The tongue, with its taste buds, detects different flavors: sweetness on the tip; acidity on the sides and lower sides; saltiness on the front sides; and bitterness at the back of the tongue. Regarding aromas, all those flavor sensations such as fruits are actually aromas that move from the mouth through the retronasal passage to the olfactory nerves. In this case, the brain registers the information as if it were a flavor. Lastly, we need to measure the time it takes for all the aromas to disappear from our mouth. This phenomenon is called “aftertaste” or “persistence.”

### Textures
When analyzing textures, we see that density is generated through water, alcohol, and sugars. But there are other compounds that change the texture of the wine. Acids increase saliva and soften the sugars and alcohol. However, tannins tend to make the wine denser in texture. We will see that the older the wines are, the smoother their texture becomes, as tannins become softer over time.

## Step #4: Aftertaste (or "Finish")

After you have smelled and tasted the wine, swallow it and observe what happens next. Do you notice new tastes or aromas? Is the aftertaste pleasant or bad? Does the alcohol make for a hot, rough experience—or is it barely detectable? How long do the aromas remain in your mouth and nose? This is the "finish" of the wine.

## How to Learn More About Wine From Tasting

- Follow the steps above and pay close attention each time you taste wine.
- Taste "blind"—without knowledge of what you are analyzing—to avoid bias.
- Taste more than one wine at a time; differentiate them carefully, side-by-side.
- Start with wines from classical appellations, not exotics. (See a good textbook.)
- Occasionally buy wines at higher prices—these are the best representatives.
- If that's not in your budget, skip a few value bottles to save for better ones.


## Pairing by Agreement
Pairing by agreement occurs when the wine and the dish resemble each other or have the same characteristics. This is called understanding by similarity. Classic examples include: grilled steak with Malbec; salmon with Pinot Noir; seafood salad with unoaked Chardonnay; pork tenderloin with Merlot. Also included in this list are lentil stew with Bonarda (aged in barrels) and stuffed pasta with red sauce with Cabernet Franc.

## Pairing by Contraposition
In this case, the characteristics of the wine and the food are completely opposite. Here, they complement each other through differentiation. Emblematic cases are: blue cheese with sweet wine; Salteñas empanadas with Torrontés; Asian cuisine with Torrontés; spicy dishes with light white wines.

## Wines and Red Meats
- **Fatty meats**: Pair wonderfully with intense red varieties aged in barrels. Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Bonarda, Petit Verdot, and Tannat.
- **Lean meats**: Prefer reds with slight barrel aging and varieties with medium or low tannins. Pinot Noir, Merlot, Tempranillo (Argentina), and Sangiovese.

## Wines and Fish
- **Fatty fish**: Pair well with whites aged in barrels (Chardonnay, Viognier, Semillon) or light reds (Pinot Noir, Merlot).
- **Lean fish**: Combine nicely with light, fresh, fruity white wines (Sauvignon Blanc, Torrontés, Tocai Friulano).

## Wines and White Meats
- **Chicken and pork**: Pair excellently with light red wines or those with slight barrel aging (Pinot Noir is a versatile choice). Young Malbecs or modern Cabernet Sauvignons also work well. They also pair with unoaked Merlot or young Cabernet Franc. Among whites, the ideal varieties are Chardonnay (lightly oaked), Viognier, or Semillon.

## Rosé Wines
What about rosé wine? It stands out for its versatility. Despite being underrated by local palates, demand is starting to grow, especially for wines made in the Provence style (very delicate, almost imperceptible color).

Rosé labels are great options to pair with:
- Appetizers
- Chicken and pork
- Certain red meats (flank steak, eye of round, sirloin tip, tenderloin)
- Shrimp, seafood, shellfish salads
- Both lean and fatty fish

## Wine and Spicy Foods
Why doesn’t "spicy" pair with "spicy"? Because it creates an opposite, negative effect. Unpleasant metallic or distorted flavors may appear.

Spice plus spice equals "fire" for the palate. Too much intensity, too much heat. Therefore, it’s important to tone down that spicy sensation with a white wine that is agile, fresh, light, and not very voluminous. Examples of varieties include: Torrontés, Sauvignon Blanc, Tocai or unoaked Viognier.

## Wine and Sweet Foods
Ideally, sweet pairs with sweet. Cakes, desserts, fruits, and sweet dishes pair perfectly with demi-sec or sweet sparkling wines and late harvest or natural sweet wines.

Imagine, dear reader, how a grilled steak would pair with a sweet wine. It wouldn’t match at all!

## Wines and Salty Foods
In general, any food with a high saline component is complex to pair. In this case, we need wines with mineral notes. Pinot Noir and Sauvignon Blanc are very good options to complement these dishes.

## Impossible Pairings?
Yes, there are impossible pairings. This happens between red wines with marked, intense, and present tannins and seafood or salty dishes. Examples (to avoid): oysters and Cabernet Sauvignon, sushi and Syrah, sole and Petit Verdot.

## Wines and Cheeses
In this classic pairing, which stirs much passion among curious gourmets, the raw materials used to make the cheeses (cow, goat, sheep, buffalo, mixes) and the production method (lactic coagulation, unpressed paste, washed rind, internal mold, and aging) are influential.

#### Wines and Fresh Cheeses:
Almost none of these cheeses are eaten alone because their flavor is very neutral and mild (insipid). With mozzarella as the standard, they should be present in other foods with similarly mild flavors to avoid being overshadowed. Recommendation: very young and fresh white wines with herbaceous and floral notes pair very well, as do Brut or Demi Sec sparkling wines.

#### Wines and Medium-aged Cheeses:
Classic examples are Gouda and Emmental. In this case, we need dry white wines with good volume and barrel fermentation, and all those with a high glyceric content (unctuous Chardonnay or Semillon).

#### Cured and Aged Wines:
Historical examples are Manchego, Parmesan, Provolone, and Reggianito (depending on the degree of aging). We will need young red wines to full-bodied and evolved ones.

#### Mold-ripened Cheeses:
Brie and Camembert are the elixirs of this peculiar style. They can be accompanied by structured white wines with some acidity and very aromatic, or young, light, and fresh red wines (Pinot Noir).

#### Blue Cheeses:
Roquefort, Gorgonzola, Stilton, or Cabrales are ideal for pairing with late harvest, natural sweet, or fortified wines.
