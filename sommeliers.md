# What is wine?

Wine is the beverage produced by the alcoholic fermentation of fresh grapes or fresh grape juice (must). The origin of the vine dates back to around 6000 B.C. in the region of Mesopotamia. Initially, wine was mainly used for ceremonies and sacred rituals as offerings to the gods. This cultivation spread throughout the Mediterranean, reaching Greece, Italy, Spain, and France—countries that, due to their climate, soil, and history, have expanded the production and culture of wine across all continents. The production and consumption of wine extend worldwide. The great variety of climates, soils, the enormous number of grapevine varieties, the viticulturists and oenologists themselves, and the different techniques of winemaking, aging, and conservation have led to a great diversity of wines.

## The vine

The vine is a shrub made up of:

- Root: supplies nutrients to the vine.
- Trunk: stores reserve substances, supports the arms and shoots of the vine, and conducts water and sap.
- Arms: responsible for conducting nutrients and distributing the vegetation and fruits in space.
- Shoots (when green) or canes (when dry): send nutrients to leaves and fruit.
- Leaves: the most important organs of the vine, as they are responsible for transforming raw sap into elaborated sap and carrying out the plant's vital.- functions: transpiration, respiration, and photosynthesis.

Bunches:
clusters of grapes connected by stems to a stalk hanging from the cane.

The fruit
Grapes are the fruit expression of the vine. The bunch is divided into the following components:

- Peduncle: the connection between the shoot and the bunch.
- Rachis: the woody part of the bunch. It is usually removed as it adds acidity, roughness, and green aromas to the wine.
- Berry or grape: composed of three parts:
- Skin: contains the compounds that give color and texture to the wines, as well as most of the aromas.
- Pulp: contains the must, mostly water with sugars. It does not contribute color to the wines.
- Seeds: found inside the pulp. They provide tannins and oils that can deteriorate flavors and aromas.

# Wine Tasting Guide

## Step #1: Visual Appearance

Fill a large wine glass to about two ounces. In strong light, against a white background, tilt the glass by 45 degrees, and inspect the wine. Note whether it is clear or cloudy, brightly colored or dull, and whether there is sediment. Observe the color, including whether it is consistent or if it changes or dissipates at the rim.

## Step #2: Smell (or "Nose")

Fill your glass to about two ounces, swirl the wine in the glass (covering the glass with one hand to concentrate the aroma, if you like), and with a nose unbiased by food, perfume, or other smells, take a long, deep whiff of the wine. Look for fruit, mineral, spice, vegetable, earth, wood, and other kinds of aromas.

## Step #3: Taste (or "Palate")

Take a large amount of wine in your mouth and move it over every surface. Hold the wine in your mouth and move air in and out as well. Setting aside the aromas you noticed in the “smell” stage, try to note whether the wine is sweet, tart, sour, or bitter to the taste—and to what degree you notice heat (from alcohol), drying and friction in the mouth (from tannin), and salivation or puckering (from acid).

## Step #4: Aftertaste (or "Finish")

After you have smelled and tasted the wine, swallow it and observe what happens next. Do you notice new tastes or aromas? Is the aftertaste pleasant or bad? Does the alcohol make for a hot, rough experience—or is it barely detectable? How long do the aromas remain in your mouth and nose? This is the "finish" of the wine.

## How to Learn More About Wine From Tasting

- Follow the steps above and pay close attention each time you taste wine.
- Taste "blind"—without knowledge of what you are analyzing—to avoid bias.
- Taste more than one wine at a time; differentiate them carefully, side-by-side.
- Start with wines from classical appellations, not exotics. (See a good textbook.)
- Occasionally buy wines at higher prices—these are the best representatives.
- If that's not in your budget, skip a few value bottles to save for better ones.
