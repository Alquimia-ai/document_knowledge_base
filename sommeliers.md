# What is wine?

Wine is the beverage produced by the alcoholic fermentation of fresh grapes or fresh grape juice (must). The origin of the vine dates back to around 6000 B.C. in the region of Mesopotamia. Initially, wine was mainly used for ceremonies and sacred rituals as offerings to the gods. This cultivation spread throughout the Mediterranean, reaching Greece, Italy, Spain, and France—countries that, due to their climate, soil, and history, have expanded the production and culture of wine across all continents. The production and consumption of wine extend worldwide. The great variety of climates, soils, the enormous number of grapevine varieties, the viticulturists and oenologists themselves, and the different techniques of winemaking, aging, and conservation have led to a great diversity of wines.

## The wine

The vine is a shrub made up of:

- Root: supplies nutrients to the vine.
- Trunk: stores reserve substances, supports the arms and shoots of the vine, and conducts water and sap.
- Arms: responsible for conducting nutrients and distributing the vegetation and fruits in space.
- Shoots (when green) or canes (when dry): send nutrients to leaves and fruit.
- Leaves: the most important organs of the vine, as they are responsible for transforming raw sap into elaborated sap and carrying out the plant's vital.- functions: transpiration, respiration, and photosynthesis.

Bunches:
clusters of grapes connected by stems to a stalk hanging from the cane.

The fruit
Grapes are the fruit expression of the vine. The bunch is divided into the following components:

- Peduncle: the connection between the shoot and the bunch.
- Rachis: the woody part of the bunch. It is usually removed as it adds acidity, roughness, and green aromas to the wine.
- Berry or grape: composed of three parts:
- Skin: contains the compounds that give color and texture to the wines, as well as most of the aromas.
- Pulp: contains the must, mostly water with sugars. It does not contribute color to the wines.
- Seeds: found inside the pulp. They provide tannins and oils that can deteriorate flavors and aromas.


# Wine Production

## Transport 
It is carried out as gently as possible so that the grapes do not arrive damaged and premature fermentation does not occur. High-quality wines receive selected bunches transported in small boxes of a maximum of 15 kg.

## Destemming 
The rachis is removed to prevent these woody parts from providing acids, roughness, and green aromas. In some red wines, the rachis is left to allow internal fermentation of the grape (carbonic maceration) or to acquire more herbaceous aromas. When not removed in white wines, the goal is to achieve a gentler extraction of the must.

## Crushing
Without breaking the seeds, the grapes are crushed to facilitate the release of the must from the interior. Contact between the skins and the must is necessary to give the wine color and texture.

## Fermentation and maceration
 This is the process of transforming the sugars contained in the must into alcohol thanks to the action of yeasts (micro-fungi). Temperature control is very important because if it is too low or too high, the yeasts will stop functioning. The fermentation time varies depending on the grape varieties, temperature, yeasts, and especially our determination, as we can decide when to stop it. This generates the different types of wine based on the residual sugar content (unfermented):
    - Dry: Less than 5 grams of residual sugar per liter.
    - Semi-dry: Between 15 and 30 grams of residual sugar per liter.
    - Sweet: More than 50 grams of residual sugar per liter.
 In addition, while fermentation is taking place, the maceration of skins and must occurs, adding more color and texture to the wine. Since the carbon dioxide produced by the yeast pushes the skins to the upper area, we will move the skins through remontage (pumping must from the lower part to the upper part using a hose) and punching down (submerging the skins into the must from the upper part).

 In white and rosé wines, this maceration is done before fermentation, simply by leaving the skins and must in contact.

## Pressing
 After fermentation, the liquid part (free-run wine) is drained from the tank, and the solid part is taken to a press. Pressing helps us extract the last part of the wine, which will be the least harsh, and it will be mixed with the previously reserved free-run wine.

Within the aging process of wine, we will discover two storage systems: the barrel and the bottle with cork:

## Barrel
It is the wooden container (usually oak) where the wine will remain during its first phase of aging. Generally, it has a capacity of 225 liters (Bordeaux, used in Rioja), although there are barrels of other volumes. When the barrel is made through the use of fire, different types of toasts are created, which disappear with use and contact with the wine. Thus, the newer the barrel, the more intense the effect on the wine. Additionally, the porosity of the wood causes the wine to oxidize more quickly. Newer barrels have a more open porosity, so the oxidation is faster, while older barrels result in slower oxidation. The type of oak or its origin gives different types of aromas and oxidation to the wine.
    - French oak:gives a toasted touch, it is an oak with lower pore density and more elegance, so it is recommended to shorten the aging time in the barrel. The oxidation is less, thus maintaining the fruit much fresher.
    - American oak: provides a more woody and aggressive contribution due to the higher concentration of tannins. This aggressiveness softens over time, providing pleasant spicy notes. The oxidation is more intense.

## Bottle and Cork
After the time in the barrel, the wine needs a resting period in the bottle so that the characteristics of the wine and those acquired in the barrel harmonize and blend properly. During this period, it is very important to keep the bottle lying down so that the wine soaks the cork, keeping it moist and airtight, and preventing oxygen from entering. Bottles should be stored in places free from air currents and temperature changes, with a relative humidity above 70%. The larger the container, the slower the wine's aging process.

The cork's function is to prevent the entry of oxygen, microorganisms, and bacteria that can damage or alter the wine in the bottle. Corks are approximately 45 to 55 mm in length. Their length will delay oxygen from entering the bottle. When the cork dries out, it can cause openings through which oxidation can occur. For good preservation, bottles should be placed horizontally so that the wine soaks the cork and keeps it moist. It is important to note that cork does not leave odors, but its reaction with chlorines can generate cave, mold, or wet cardboard aromas, known as “cork taint” or TCA.


# Wine Tasting Guide

## Step #1: Visual Appearance

Fill a large wine glass to about two ounces. In strong light, against a white background, tilt the glass by 45 degrees, and inspect the wine. Note whether it is clear or cloudy, brightly colored or dull, and whether there is sediment. Observe the color, including whether it is consistent or if it changes or dissipates at the rim.

## Step #2: Smell (or "Nose")

Fill your glass to about two ounces, swirl the wine in the glass (covering the glass with one hand to concentrate the aroma, if you like), and with a nose unbiased by food, perfume, or other smells, take a long, deep whiff of the wine. Look for fruit, mineral, spice, vegetable, earth, wood, and other kinds of aromas.

## Step #3: Taste (or "Palate")

Take a large amount of wine in your mouth and move it over every surface. Hold the wine in your mouth and move air in and out as well. Setting aside the aromas you noticed in the “smell” stage, try to note whether the wine is sweet, tart, sour, or bitter to the taste—and to what degree you notice heat (from alcohol), drying and friction in the mouth (from tannin), and salivation or puckering (from acid).

## Step #4: Aftertaste (or "Finish")

After you have smelled and tasted the wine, swallow it and observe what happens next. Do you notice new tastes or aromas? Is the aftertaste pleasant or bad? Does the alcohol make for a hot, rough experience—or is it barely detectable? How long do the aromas remain in your mouth and nose? This is the "finish" of the wine.

## How to Learn More About Wine From Tasting

- Follow the steps above and pay close attention each time you taste wine.
- Taste "blind"—without knowledge of what you are analyzing—to avoid bias.
- Taste more than one wine at a time; differentiate them carefully, side-by-side.
- Start with wines from classical appellations, not exotics. (See a good textbook.)
- Occasionally buy wines at higher prices—these are the best representatives.
- If that's not in your budget, skip a few value bottles to save for better ones.
